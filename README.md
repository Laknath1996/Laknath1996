### Hello there!

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. I broadly work on {statistical, deep} learning, with an aspiration of reducing the gap between machine and natural intelligence. My doctoral research focuses on learning under non-stationary distributions and distribution shifts, with applications in large language models, computer vision, and biomedical data science.
